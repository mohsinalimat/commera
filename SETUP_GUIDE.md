- **Payments** (for payment gateway integration)

### System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Database: MariaDB/PostgreSQL

### ERPNext Setup Requirements
Before installing Commera, ensure these are configured in ERPNext:

- ✅ Price Lists created (e.g., "Standard Selling")
- ✅ Chart of Accounts configured
- ✅ At least one Item Attribute (e.g., "Color", "Size")

---

## Installation

### Quick Start with Demo Data

If you want to quickly test Commera with demo products, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Using Commera Settings (Recommended)

1. Navigate to: **Desk → Commera Ecommerce → Commera Settings**
2. Scroll to **Demo Data & Testing** section
3. Click **"Install Demo Data"** button
4. Wait for completion notification
5. Click **"Publish All Items to Website"** button if items don't show
6. Visit `https://your-site.com/en/products`

#### Option 2: Using Command Line

```bash
# After installing commera
bench --site your-site-name execute commera.install_summer_demo.install_summer_demo
```

This seeds the Summer storefront in **SAR**. Pass `--kwargs '{"currency": "INR"}'` for a rupee store;
the supported currencies are the keys of `CURRENCY_PROFILES` in `commera/install_summer_demo.py`.
The seeder is idempotent — run it as often as you like.

Currency is a parameter, not a constant: one run puts the system default, the company, every account
under it, all three price lists and every Item Price into the same currency, and restates the demo
catalogue, the shipping rule, the COD charge and the hero-slide copy at that currency's scale. A store
whose company and price list disagree cannot submit a single Sales Invoice, which is what makes this
the setting to get right before anything else.

#### Rebuilding a demo site from nothing

Five commands take you from an empty bench to a storefront that can complete a paid checkout:

```bash
SITE=ls-shop-sar.localhost

bench new-site $SITE --admin-password admin
bench --site $SITE install-app erpnext commera
bench --site $SITE execute frappe.desk.page.setup_wizard.setup_wizard.setup_complete --kwargs '{"args": {"language": "en", "country": "Saudi Arabia", "timezone": "Asia/Riyadh", "currency": "SAR", "company_name": "Lifestyle Demo", "company_abbr": "LSD", "chart_of_accounts": "Standard", "fy_start_date": "2026-01-01", "fy_end_date": "2026-12-31", "full_name": "Administrator", "email": "admin@example.com", "password": "admin"}}'
bench --site $SITE migrate
bench --site $SITE execute commera.install_summer_demo.install_summer_demo --kwargs '{"currency": "SAR"}'
```

Two things about that order are load-bearing:

- **`bench migrate` before the seeder.** `Shop Theme` records sync on migrate and not on install-app,
  so activating the Summer theme straight after install throws "Could not find Active Theme".
- **The setup wizard will log `MandatoryError: [Item Group, ...]: custom_displayname`.** commera makes
  that field mandatory, so ERPNext cannot insert its own stock groups. The wizard still completes and
  the storefront does not use those groups; the errors are noise.

**What Gets Created:**
- ✅ Item Attributes (Color, Size)
- ✅ Brands (Adidas, Nike, Puma, Lifestyle Store)
- ✅ Price Lists (Standard Selling, Sale Price List)
- ✅ Shipping Rule (Free shipping over $50)
- ✅ 3 Demo Products with variants (~40 SKUs)
- ✅ Style Attribute Configurators & Variants
- ✅ Configured Commera Settings
- ✅ Published to website with Commera routes

After installation, immediately visit:
- `https://your-site.com/en/products` to see the demo store
- Test the complete purchase workflow

### Step 1: Install Required Apps

If not already installed, install the dependencies:

```bash
# Install ERPNext (if not installed)
bench get-app erpnext
bench --site your-site-name install-app erpnext

# Install Webshop
bench get-app webshop
bench --site your-site-name install-app webshop

# Install Payments
bench get-app payments
bench --site your-site-name install-app payments
```

### Step 2: Install Commera

```bash
# Get the Commera app
bench get-app https://github.com/BuildWithHussain/commera

# Install on your site
bench --site your-site-name install-app commera

# Build assets
bench build --app commera
```

### Step 3: Restart Services

```bash
bench restart
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

After installation, Commera will automatically create:
- ✅ Ecommerce Item Groups (All Item Groups → Ecommerce Website → Men, Women, Kids)
- ✅ Email Templates (Order Confirmation, Order Cancellation, Item In Stock)
- ✅ Payment Mode: Telr

Check that these were created successfully by navigating to:
- **Desk → Stock → Item Group** - You should see "Ecommerce Website" with child groups
